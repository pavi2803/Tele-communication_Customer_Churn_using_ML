# Telecommunication-Customer-Churn-
The business objective of this data is to execute the necessary ML algorithms and predict the final model, considering the target variable as Churn, which here implies whether the customer is profitable or loss making to the company indicated by 1 and 0, based on the independent variables which express customer information regarding their telecommunication service details with the company, such that necessary initiatives can be taken upon profitable customers based on significant variables.

About the dataset: This dataset is on a Telecommunication company which includes the customer information regarding their decisions registered against the various telecommunication services registered with the company.
Variable description: 
Total variables: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges. The variables are in themselves self-explanatory by nature in context to the business problem.
Target variable: Churn.
Deliverables: Perceive the business problem and solve it by predicting the best fitted model, using the necessary ML algorithms and submit the .ipynb files for marking.
